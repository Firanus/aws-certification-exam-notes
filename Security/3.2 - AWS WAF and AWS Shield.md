# 3.2 - AWS WAF and AWS Shield

In this lecture we'll be looking at AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) and AWS Shield. Distinguishing between these two services is key for the CCP exam.

## AWS WAF

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web applications from common exploits, that could, for instance, affect application availability, compormise security or consume excessive resources.

To give a little more detail, a WAF inspects all incoming traffic into your application and tries to keep an eye out for anything malicious. (In the OSI 7-level security framework, a WAF defends level 7, the application layer, but this is outside the scope of this course).

## AWS Shield

AWS Shield is a managed DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service that defends web applications running on AWS.

AWS Shield provides always-on detection, and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced

Advanced obviously provides greater protections (including cost reimbursements for any charges incurred by the attack), but is also costs Â£3000 a month, so enable it or not as dictated by your available funds.
