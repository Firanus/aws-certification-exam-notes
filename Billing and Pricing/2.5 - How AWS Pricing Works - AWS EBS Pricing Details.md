# 2.5 - How AWS Pricing Works - AWS EBS Pricing Details

EBS provides block-level storage to be used with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are off-instance volumes that persist independently from the life of an instance; they're essentially virtual disks in the cloud. There're two main types:
* **SSD-backed volumes** - Optimized for transactional based worloads that involve frequent read-write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.
* **HDD-backed volumes** - Optimized for large treaming workloads where throughput (measured in megabits per second) is a better performance measure than IOPS.

## Pricing Factors

EBS pricing has 3 factors:
* **Volumes** - Volume storage for EBS volume is charged by the number of GB you *provision* per month, until you release the storage.
* **Snapshots** - Snapshot storage is based on the amount of space yur data consumes in S3. Because EBS doesn't store empty blocks, this is likely to be much less than your volume size. Copying EBS snapshots is charged based on the volume of data transferred across regions. Finally, the first time a volume is snapshotted, EBS stores a fill copy to S3. Subsequent snapshots only store the incremental changes.
* **Data Transfer** - Outbound data transfer charges are tiered, inbound are free.
