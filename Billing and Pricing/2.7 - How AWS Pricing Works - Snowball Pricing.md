# 2.7 - How AWS Pricing Works - Snowball Pricing

AWS Snowball is a Petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses the common challenges associated with large scale data transports including:
* High network costs, 
* Long transfer times 
* Security concerns


Using Snowball, you pay a service fee per data transfer job, and the cost of shipping the appliance. Each job includes the use of a snowball appliance for 10 days of onsite usage for free. For a small extra charge, days can be added on. Shipping days, including days ot receive the device and the day it is shipped back, are not included in the free 10 days. Finally, data transferred into AWS does not incur any data transfer fees, and standard S3 pricing rules apply.
