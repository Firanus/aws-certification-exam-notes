# 2.13 - Tagging and Resource Groups

**Tags** are just key-value pairs that we can attach to our AWS resources. Normally, they'll be used to record metadata (data about data).

Tags can sometimes be inherited. An example would be if we tagged a stack in CloudFormation with a particular tag (say, Department: Finance), then all the resources that stack spun up would inherit that tag.

Tags can also be used to carry specific information. For instance, on an RDS instance, we could use a tag to record our database engine.

**Resource groups** are just a tool that make it easy to use your tags to group your resources.

We have two ways of managing our resource groups. The first is to use the **Tag Editor** (which is a global service) to narrow down our full list of resources that meet specific requirements (e.g. in a certain region, of a certain type, and with certain tags). We can also use the tag editor to add new tags to resources in bulk.

The second way is to create a **classic group** in the **AWS Systems Manager**. This is a service that is specific to each region, and allows you to create groups with specific queries (that can, for instance, include tags). The resources that satisfy these queries will become members of the group, and you can then use the group to manage them, for instance by running automations against entire fleers of EC2 instances.
