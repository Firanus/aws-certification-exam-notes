# 2.10 - How AWS Pricing Works - CloudFront Pricing

CloudFront is AWS's global content delivery network (CDN).

CloudFront's pricing model is entirely based on data transfered and requests made. There are no upfront payments, fixed platform fees and no premiums for dynamic content. Plus, you can get started for free.

When you begin to estimate the cost of CloudFront, consider the following:

* **Traffic distribution** - Data transfer and request pricing varies across geographic regions, and pricing is based on the edge location through which your content is served
* **Requests** - The number and type of requests (HTTP or HTTPS), and the geographic region the requests were made from
* **Data Transfer Out** - The amount of data transfered out of your CloudFront edge locations.
