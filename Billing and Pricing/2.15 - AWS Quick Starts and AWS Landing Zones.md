# 2.15 - AWS Quick Starts and AWS Landing Zones

**AWS Quick Starts** is a service provided by AWS which consists of a large collection of CloudFormation templates. Each of these templates has been designed by an AWS expert in the given technology, and is designed to make it easy for users to start setting up an environment appropriate to whatever their chosen tech stack might be. 

As with all services that rely on CloudFormation, while the templates Quick Starts provides are free, any resources they provision you will have to pay for.

**AWS Landing Zone** on the other hand is a tool for automating the creation of a multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.
