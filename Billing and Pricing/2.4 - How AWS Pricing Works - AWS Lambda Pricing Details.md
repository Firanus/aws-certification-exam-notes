# 2.4 - How AWS Pricing Works - AWS Lambda

Lambda is AWS's serverless offering; it allows you to run code without needing to provision or manage servers.

## AWS Lambda Pricing

Lambda only charges you for what you use. In particular, you're charged for the:
 * **Number of Requests** - Lambda registers a request each time it starts executing in response to an event notification or an invoke call (including test invokes from the console). You're charged for the total number of requests across all your functions
 * **Execution Duration** - This is calculated from the time you code begins executing until either it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds. The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function.

### Request Pricing
  * Free Tier - 1 million requests per month, 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month
  * $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter, or $0.0000002 per request

### Duration Pricing
  * 400,000 GB-seconds per month free, up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time.
  * $0.00001667 for every GB-second used thereafter

## Additional Charges

You can incur additional charges if your lambda function uses other AWS services or transfers data. E.g. if your Lambda functions reads and writes to S3, those requests, and the data stored, will incur additional costs.
