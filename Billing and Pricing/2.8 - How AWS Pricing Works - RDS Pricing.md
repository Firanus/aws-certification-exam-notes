# 2.8 - How AWS Pricing Works - RDS Pricing

RDS is Amazon's relational database service. The factors drive its costs include:

* **Clock Hours of server time** - i.e. the time your resources are running
* **Database charecteristics** - these include the database engine, the size and its memory class
* **Database purchase type** - i.e. reserved (for 1 or 3 year term) or on-demand
* **Number of database instances** - e.g. new databases which are spun up to handle peak loads
* **Provisioned storage** - If you have an active DB instance, there is no additional charge for backup storage of up to 100% of your provisioned database storage. Once the DB instance is terminated, you pay per GB per month for backup storage
* **Additional storage** - The amount of backup storage over your provisioned storage amount is paid per GB per month.
* **Requests** - The number of input and output requests to the database are charged.
* **Deployment type** - e.g. single or multi-AZ. Storage and I/O costs will vary depending on the number of AZs you can deploy too.
* **Data Transfer** - Inbound data transfer is free, outbound data transfer costs are tiered.
