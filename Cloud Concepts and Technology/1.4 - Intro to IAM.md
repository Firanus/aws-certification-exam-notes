# 1.4 - Intro to IAM (Identity Access Management)

IAM stands for Identity Acess Management. It's important to note that it is *global*; you don't need to specify a region when you use it, and then you create a user or a group, that user or group is created globally.

The **root account** of your AWS account is the email address you used to set up your AWS accound. It always has full admin access. As such, you should never give those account credentials away to anyone. Always secure it using MFA.

Instead, you should create IAM users with restricted permissions, and distribute those to people who need to access the AWS account.

## Granting Access to IAM users

There are 3 main ways for IAM users to access AWS. They are:

1. **Programmatic access (i.e. the console)** - by using an account key ID and a secret access key
2. **AWS Management Console access** - by using a specially enabled password to log in through the AWS Management console
3. **SDK access** - by accessing AWS through SDKs, which we will cover off later.

## Identity Policies

When creating IAM users, its necessary to set up their permissions. One way to do this is to use groups. A group is just a place to store users with specific permissions, which are applied as policies. Examples might include SysAdmins, Developers and Finance.

Amazon manages a list of ever-expanding permission policies (as of 7th Jan 2018 there were 406) which should handle most normal use cases. These are written in **JSON**, which can come up in the exam.

You can also set the policies directly on users when you create them, but this is typically not the recommended solution.

## Tags

You can also apply generic key-value tags to your users, and organise them using those. Examples include employee numbers, departments and the like.
