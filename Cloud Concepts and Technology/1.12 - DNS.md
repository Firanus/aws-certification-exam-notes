# 1.12 - DNS and Domain Names

DNS, or Domain Name System, is the process that computers use to resolve domain names to IP addresses. It operates analogously to phone book; the computer looks up the domain name you type into your browser, translastes it to an IP address, and sends you to that address.

There are a number of different record types, but they aren't important for the certified cloud practitioner course; we'll learn them in much more detail when we do the solution architect associate course.

## Route 53

Route 53 is the name of AWS's domain name service. It takes its name from the famous Route 66 in America. As it operates on Port 53, it became Route 53.

Route 53 is global, in a similar way to IAM and S3.
